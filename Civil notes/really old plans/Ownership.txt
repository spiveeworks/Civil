OWNERSHIP:

By default there is no such thing as ownership, however different forms of 
ownership can form through social interactions.

Ownership is fundamentally dependent on territory, as the presence of objects 
in a territory is what affects the nature of the need for ownership.


PRIVACY:

Privacy is crucial in the development of ownership based standards;



FORMAL OWNERSHIP:

A governing body sets a standard of ownership by facilitating trade and/or 
facilitating the incentivisation of government/community associated work.

The body can then optionally facilitate the communication of rules of 
ownership, and optionally facilitate the punishment of failure to meet these 
rules.
